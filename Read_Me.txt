Project Name:
Customer Segmentation using Tree-Based Generative Models

Overview :
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using various clustering techniques and tree-based generative models. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, synthetic data generation, and clustering analysis on multiple datasets.

Project Structure :

Main Directory :
Data (Folder): Contains subfolders for each dataset.
AirlinePassengerSatisfaction.py: Code for the AirlinePassengerSatisfaction dataset.
CustomerPersonalityAnalysis.py: Code for the CustomerPersonalityAnalysis dataset.
HotelCustomers.py: Code for the HotelCustomers dataset.
ECommerceDatasetChurn.py: Code for the ECommerceDatasetChurn dataset.
ShopCustomerData.py: Code for the ShopCustomerData dataset.
SupermarketDataset.py: Code for the SupermarketDataset dataset.
AirData.py: Code for the AirData dataset.

Data Folder :
Each subfolder is named after a dataset and contains:
CSV files of the dataset.
Plots generated during the analysis.

Datasets :
The datasets used in this project are:
AirlinePassengerSatisfaction
CustomerPersonalityAnalysis
HotelCustomers
ECommerceDatasetChurn
ShopCustomerData
SupermarketDataset
AirData

Running the Code :

Prerequisites :
Before running the code, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

Python: Version 3.6 or higher
pip: Python package installer

Required Python Libraries
Install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn scipy arfpy

Running the Code for a Dataset
Below is an example of how to run the code for the CustomerPersonalityAnalysis dataset:

Navigate to the project directory:
cd path/to/project

Run the script:
python CustomerPersonalityAnalysis.py



This project demonstrates the use of tree-based generative models for customer segmentation across various datasets. By following the steps above, you can replicate the analysis and explore customer segments in different datasets.
